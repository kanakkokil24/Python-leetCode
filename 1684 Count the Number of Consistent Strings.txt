1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

 

Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        for word in words:
            flag = 0
            for x in word:
                if x not in allowed:
                    flag = 1
            if flag ==0:
                stack.append(word)
        return(len(stack))
