1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

 

Example 1:

Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

Solution 

class Solution:
    def canBeTypedWords(self, text: str, brokenLetters: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for word in text.split():
            flag = 0
            for x in brokenLetters:
                if x in word:
                    flag = 1
                    break
            if flag == 0:
                count = count +1
        return(count)
