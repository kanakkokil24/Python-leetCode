136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Solution 

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for x in nums:
            if nums.count(x)==1:
                return(x)
        return("")
