1196. How Many Apples Can You Put into the Basket

You have some apples and a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.

Given an integer array weight where weight[i] is the weight of the ith apple, return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.

 

Example 1:

Input: weight = [100,200,150,1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfApples(self, weight: List[int]) -> int:
        weight = sorted(weight)
        sum1 = 0
        count = 0
        for x in weight:
            if sum1+x <= 5000:
                sum1 = sum1+x
                count = count+1
        return(count)
