1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [A, B] where:

A and B are No-Zero integers.
A + B = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.
Example 2:

Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]

Solution 


class Solution:
    def getNoZeroIntegers(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(1,n):
            str1,str2 = str(i),str(n-i)
            if str1.find('0') == -1 and str2.find('0') == -1:
                return([i,n-i])
