1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".


Solution 

class Solution:
    def countGoodSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        i = 0
        stack = []
        while i < len(s)-2:
            flag = 0
            for y in s[i:i+3]:
                if s[i:i+3].count(y) !=1:
                    flag = 1
                    break
            if flag==0:
                stack.append(s[i:i+3])
            i = i+1


        return(len(stack))
