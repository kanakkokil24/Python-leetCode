Output: 4
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,3], and the sum is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements, and the sum is 0.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def sumOfUnique(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sum1=0
        for num in nums:
            if nums.count(num) == 1:
                sum1 = sum1+num
        return(sum1)
