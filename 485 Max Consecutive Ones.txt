485. Max Consecutive Ones

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Solution

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_val = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i == 1:
                count = count +1
                if count >max_val:
                    max_val = count
            else:
                count = 0
        return(max_val)
