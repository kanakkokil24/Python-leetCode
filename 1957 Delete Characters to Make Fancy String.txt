1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String


A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
Example 2:

Solution 

class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        i = 0
        stack = []
        while i < len(s)-2:
            a = s[i]
            b = s[i+1]
            c = s[i+2]
            if a != b or b !=c:
                i = i+1
                stack.append(a)
            else:
                i = i+1
        if len(s)>2:         
            stack.append(s[-2])
            stack.append(s[-1])
        else:
            return(s)
        return(''.join(stack))
