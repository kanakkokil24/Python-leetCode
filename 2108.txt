Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        for x in words:
            reversed1 = x[::-1]
            if x==reversed1:
                return(x)
        return("")
