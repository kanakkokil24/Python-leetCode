2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence

Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

 

Example 1:

Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

Solution 

class Solution:
    def countWords(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for x in words1:
            if x in words2:
                if words1.count(x) == 1 and words2.count(x) == 1:
                    count = count+1
        return(count)
