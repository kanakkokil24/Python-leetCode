1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.

A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def areOccurrencesEqual(self, s: str) -> bool:
        y = collections.Counter(s)
        temp = y.get(s[0])
        for x in y:
            if y.get(x) != temp:
                return(False)
        return(True)
