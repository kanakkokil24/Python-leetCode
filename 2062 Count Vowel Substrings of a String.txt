2062. Count Vowel Substrings of a String

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.

Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aeiouu"
Output: 2
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "aeiouu"
- "aeiouu"

Solution

class Solution:
    def countVowelSubstrings(self, word: str) -> int:
        vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}  
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(word)-4):
            j = i
            seen = set()
            while j <len(word):
                if word[j] in vowels:
                    seen.add(word[j])
                    j = j+1
                    if len(seen) == 5:
                        res = res+1
                else:
                    break
        return(res)
