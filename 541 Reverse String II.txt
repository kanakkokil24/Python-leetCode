541. Reverse String II

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"


Solution 

class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        list1 = []
        i = 0
        p = 0
        while i <len(s):
            p = p+k*2
            list1.append(s[i:p])
            i = p
        temp = ''
        for x in list1:
            y = x[:k][::-1]+x[k:]
            y = temp+''.join(y)
            temp = y
        return(y)
