1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word

Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.


Solution 

class Solution:
    def numOfStrings(self, patterns: List[str], word: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for x in patterns:
            if x in word:
                count=count+1
        return(count)
