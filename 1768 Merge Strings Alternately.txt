1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Solution 

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        if len(word1)>len(word2):
            length = len(word2)
            flag = 0
        else:
            length = len(word1)
            flag = 1
        for i in range(length):
            stack.append(word1[i])
            stack.append(word2[i])

        if flag == 0:
            return(''.join(stack)+word1[length:])
        else:
            return(''.join(stack)+word2[length:])
