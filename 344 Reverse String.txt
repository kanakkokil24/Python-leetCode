344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Solution 

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range((len(s)//2)):
            temp = s[i]
            s[i]=s[-1*i-1]
            s[-1*i-1]=temp
