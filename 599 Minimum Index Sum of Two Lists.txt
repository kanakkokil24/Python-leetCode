599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

 

Example 1:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

Solution

class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        res = defaultdict(list)
        for indx,x in enumerate(list1):
            sum1 = 0
            if x in list2:
                sum1 = indx+list2.index(x)
                res[sum1].append(x)    
        return(res.get(min(res.keys())))
