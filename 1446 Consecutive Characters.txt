1446. Consecutive Characters

The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string s, return the power of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.

Solution

class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        power = [1] * n

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if s[i] == s[j]:
                    power[i] += 1
                    #print(power[i])
                else:
                    break
        #print(power)
        return(max(power))
