1668. Maximum Repeating Substring

For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abab" is a substring in "ababc".

Solution


class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        i = 1
        while True:
            if word*i in sequence:
                #print(word*i,"  ",i)
                i+=1
            else:
                break

        return (i-1)
